# CognitoZoo
Mathematica neural net implementations (uses Mathematica MXNet v12 Machine Learning functionality)

This project provides implementations for Single Shot Detectors both VGG and MobileNet and also RetinaNet.
We also have a Tiny Yolo implementation.

The project should be very easy to install and use, so please any difficulties indicates a fault in the code or lack of clarity in the documentation, either of which should be fixible, so do please open an issue, and I will try to fix it.

The following models: SSDVGG300Pascal, SSDVGG512Pascal and SSDVGG512COCO are also available from:
https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/
(See Object Detection)
They were submitted by me and have been accepted into the official Wolfram neural net repository. You may find these models easier to use from this github repository as there are more helpful functions here to aid use.
